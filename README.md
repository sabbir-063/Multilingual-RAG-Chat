# Multilingual RAG Chat

A FastAPI-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines document indexing and question answering using Google's Gemini AI. This project enables users to upload documents, index them, and ask questions about their content in both English and Bangla languages.

## Features

- 📚 Document Indexing: Support for uploading and indexing multiple document types including Bangla PDFs
- 🔍 Semantic Search: Utilizes FAISS for efficient vector similarity search
- 🤖 Gemini AI Integration: Powered by Google's Gemini AI 2.5-flash for natural language understanding
- 🚀 Dual Interface: FastAPI backend and Command-line interface for flexible usage
- 💾 Persistent Storage: Saves indexed documents for future use
- 🌐 Multilingual Support: Full support for both English and Bangla text processing
- 🧹 Smart Text Cleaning: Language-aware text processing and special character handling
- 🛡️ Content Safety: Built-in guardrails to prevent harmful or inappropriate content

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Google Cloud API Key (for Gemini AI)
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- Sentence Transformers for embeddings

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabbir-063/Multilingual-RAG-Chat.git
cd Multilingual-RAG-Chat
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Gemini API key:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

You can use this system either through the FastAPI server or command-line interface.

### FastAPI Interface

1. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

3. Access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

#### API Endpoints

##### Upload and Index Documents
```http
POST /index/
```
- Upload one or more files to be indexed (supports both English and Bangla PDFs)
- Files will be stored in the `uploads` directory and processed for retrieval

##### Ask Questions
```http
GET /ask/?query=your_question&k=3
```
- `query`: Your question about the indexed documents (in English or Bangla)
- `k`: Number of relevant document chunks to retrieve (default: 3)
- Returns an answer generated by Gemini AI along with source information

### Command Line Interface

1. Index Documents:
```bash
python main.py index path/to/your/document.pdf
```

2. Ask Questions:
```bash
# For English questions
python main.py ask "What is the main topic?"

# For Bangla questions
python main.py ask "মূল বিষয়বস্তু কি?"
```
